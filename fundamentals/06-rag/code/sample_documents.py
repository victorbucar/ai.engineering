    per minute for Starter, 1000 for Professional, and 10000 for Enterprise.
    Rate limit headers are included in every response: X-RateLimit-Limit,

    returns HTTP 429 with a Retry-After header. The API supports pagination

    available for real-time event notifications on Professional and Enterprise
    plans. API versioning uses date-based versions in the URL path.""",
